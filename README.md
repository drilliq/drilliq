# // giulia Q //

I'm an honours Psychology student interested in Cognitive Neuroscience ðŸ§  and an avid open-source advocate ðŸ‘€! #sharetheknowledge.

## Coding! ##

I mostly code in Javascript (Vanilla, React, Next, Gatsby, Express) with the odd Java here and there. Tailwind when I'm in a hurry.

## Projects ##

I set up a new GitHub recently to get rid of all of my horrible old code and I fancied a new start. My projects all involve some web element (front- or backend). 

Feel free to check them out and send me a pull request - I'm always up for contributing and collabs.

Right now, I'm writing software for my Psychology work on extended sence of agency ðŸ¤“ (check it out!)

## The Future ##

Next of my list of things to learn are Python and Matlab - I'm going to be an academic after all ðŸŽ“
